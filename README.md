## Fuzzy Acceleration

Main goal in Fuzzy Acceleration project was to make a simulation of a sensor attached to a car, which was supposed to control car acceleration
based on its current speed, rainfall and distance from car ahead.


Sensor work was based on fuzzy logic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic). Current speed of the car, rainfall and distance from car ahead were values,
and in the process of fuzzyfication the acceleration was calculated.


Sensor simulation was also made, in which two cars were created: one controlled by the sensor, and the second one, which acceleration was randomize.
The simulation also includes changing weather conditions.
